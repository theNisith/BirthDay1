This folder is for storing additional media files like background music.

## 🎵 Adding Background Music

To add background music to the birthday website:

1. **Find a birthday song** (MP3 format recommended)
2. **Rename it** to `birthday-music.mp3`
3. **Place it** in this folder
4. The website will automatically detect and use it!

### Recommended Music Sources:
- YouTube Audio Library (free, royalty-free music)
- Free Music Archive
- Bensound.com
- Incompetech.com

### Popular Birthday Songs:
- Happy Birthday instrumental versions
- Upbeat celebration music
- Soft background music
- Your girlfriend's favorite song!

## 📝 Note
The music toggle button is already implemented in the website. Users can click the 🎵 button to start/stop the music.

**Browser Note**: Most browsers require user interaction before playing audio, so the music will start only after the user clicks the music toggle button.
